    'Completely useless stickers is an evil project by a lazy graphic-designer who doesn’t want to do anything useful to earn money but be completely useless instead. This project embraces the art of doing nothing important while maximizing confusion, awkward moments, and pointless chaos in the world. Each sticker is a deliberate attempt to make everyday objects bewilder you—and make your life a lot less productive.',
